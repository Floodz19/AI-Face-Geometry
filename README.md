# AI Face Geometry Calculator

Python code that accurately detects a user's eyes, face, and other features to Calculate Bilateral Face Symmetry and Canthal Tilt. This project is being continued in the Aesthesa Repository [https://github.com/Floodz19/Aesthesa] as I switched to Swift code.

App Project moved from Python code [Visual Studio] --> Swift code [Xcode]

Repository name : AI-Face-Geometry --> Aesthesa
